# Guess My Number

Guess a number (between 1 and 20) enter it, and click the Check button. The game has randomly generated a secret number. If the game matches your number, you win. But in every attempt that is not equal, one of the scores is reduced. Your highest scores are saved in Highscore. You can reset the game with the Again button. But the Highscore is not reset.

Enjoy the game.
